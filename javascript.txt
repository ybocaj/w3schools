/*
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare a new:

  Array
  Object
  Function
  RegExp

can change properties and elements in objects/arrays, but can't reassign
which means you can change an index [0] or push (to add to the array)
but you can't change it by using the array name and changing it
meaning
cars[0] = "new car"; will work
but you can't say cars = [and make a new array with the same named array], so push or change an specific element.

and same goes for objects.  change car.color or car.owner -- properties -- but you can't use the name of the object to change all the properties, like above
car = {changing the properties this way won't work}

    <h1>Variables, Let, Const & Data Types</h1>
    <p id='letVariable'></p>
    <p id='constVariable'></p>
    <script>                   // I did the script, the above was already there for this challenge
        // Add your JavaScript code here
        let x = 10;
        document.getElementById("letVariable").innerHTML = x;  
        const y = 20;
        document.getElementById("constVariable").innerHTML = y;
